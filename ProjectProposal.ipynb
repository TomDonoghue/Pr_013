    "Every day drivers across the United States are stopped by police officers and issued traffic tickets. Often, drivers get pulled over for a few common reasons, such as speeding, distracted driving, equipment violations, tailgating and improper lane changes, etc. However, there might be other factors such as race, gender, and age, as well as time of day and location, that could impact both whether a driver is pulled over for a traffic violation, as well as the severity of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for background information, we did some research on the issue of police vehicle stops to further making predictions for this project. One of the articles we found indicated that a larger portion of black and hispanic drivers were being pulled over as opposed to white drivers. Additionally, a similar analysis conducted on traffic stop data showed that black and hispanic drivers were “more likely than white drivers to be searched following a traffic stop”. Plus, based on our own experiences, as well as those of others frequently heard about in the media, we came to the prediction that minority groups may possible be targeted with more severe or frequent citations. As for gender, there are existing stereotypes that women normally have a harder time on the road compared to men. Plus, gender ideologies that have been established lead us to the prediction that women tend to get pulled over more often. Looking into this data would help clarify these stereotypes and ideologies.\n",

    "As we all know police officers can’t randomly pull drivers over and give tickets without having probable cause, like speeding or equipment violations. However, there might be cases where you feel as though you are not at fault but afraid to fight back against them because police officers have higher authority. In fact, we ourselves had experienced being pulled over and getting tickets for unreasonable situations. We believe this information may be important for us and others to figure out a way to back up ourselves under circumstances that we don’t feel at fault. In any case, whether these variables have some correlation or relationship with traffic violations would be both interesting and useful to know.\n",

    "To start our analyses, we will likely need to divide the dataset into multiple sets categorized by what relationship we are researching. Currently we have one large set with information such as race, gender, and age, but it may be easier to plot and analyze this data if we separate them and then possibly refer to the second dataset with the traffic stop results. We may also split the dataset as currently it has information for both moving and equipment violations together, sorted by the data of which the stop was recorded. Additionally, the data contains information about the police service area in which the stop occurred. We will likely have to do more research on these service codes to perform any meaningful analysis with them. There is also data provided that is lacking information in one or more categories (race, gender, etc), so we will have to remove these as part of our analysis. In general, we will most likely start with removing the incomplete data, combining the first dataset with the traffic stop results, and then separating them into categories to analyze independently.\n",

    "One of our goals in our analysis is to find these potential confounds in the data. For example, if it’s true that race/gender/age have some relationship with the time, frequency, length, and results of traffic stops, it is our hope that we will find out. However, to do so we will likely need extra information about the demographics of San Diego drivers, as it is difficult to generalize how often a specific category of drivers is being stopped without knowing information about who is on the road in the first place. A potential pitfall may be in drawing a conclusion from this data without placing it into the proper context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data we are using is provided by the city, it is unlikely that it is biased, so hopefully we won’t run into any issues in that regard. However, based on some of the background information we found, there is already research claiming that there is some significance to the relationship between traffic stop frequency and race/gender, so it’s important that we don’t allow this information to influence our analysis. If our analysis methods don’t work we will do some more research and see what other methods we can use to potentially discover any relationships in the data. There is no harm in our hypothesis being wrong as whatever we discover from our analysis will be useful to use regardless- whether there is any significant relationship between these variables or not.
